# DataScienceRepository
Repository with Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning Classification Methods



The Repository contains a set of different Classifiers:
Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM Neural Networks and CNN neural networks.
The data are contained in the test.txt.
In order to use the programs You will need to start form the start.py which will ask you which classifier to use.

You can customize it by changing the input data and only the feature extraction part (contained in Methods.py), all methods take input train and test data sets.
